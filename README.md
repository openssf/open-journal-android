# openJournal Android
### _This repository has been archived._

#### openJournal was supposed to be a simple notes platform, but due to better competition, lack of interest, and bad product it was shut down on November 23, 2017. It remains here for history's sake, although it serves no inherent purpose.

#### I suppose I will look back on this in many years and reflect on how bad I was at Android development..

#### Below is what the release notes used to say:

##### Note: if you're still using openJournal (I don't know why you would be) I suggest [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org) as an alternative.
